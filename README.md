# Internship-Project

My internship project at Vercon Technologies is about full stack development. I have created a website for a restaurant that allows users to book their tickets online. The website has a front-end interface that is user-friendly and responsive, and a back-end server that handles the data and logic. The back-end is built with Node.js and MongoDB, which are popular and powerful technologies for web development. The project has given me valuable experience in designing, developing, and deploying a full stack web application.
